##Code 301 Daily Learning Journal 4

I'll admit, the last couple lectures we've had have been a lot of totally new and mind blowing information thrown at us at once, so it's a little hard for me to keep up at this point.  However, a lot of this seems super interesting and I'm excited to delve more into it! Like with the apis that we have at our disposal; I was stoked when the Star Wars api came out in class to be perfectly honest.  A little intimidated by the next few labs because it's more conceptual understanding than actual finishing of TODO's, but I'm happy to learn more and more.
