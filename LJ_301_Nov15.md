##Code 301 Daily Learning Journal Nov 15

The project is going well so far!  Even though we've changed our database/storage strategy like 3 times we are still on track to have completed the MVP by midday today.  Working on CSS was difficult but a nice break from the complicated functionality of the JavaScript pages.  However, after putting all of our pieces together I think everyone has a great understanding of how we are doing and what our app can do so far, as well as where we need to focus our attention for today. Halfway through project week already!!
