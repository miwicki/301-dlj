## Code 301 Day 3

Coming back after being sick on day 2 was hard to catch up, but I'm feeling on track now! I totally feel up to speed on concepts, but need to catch up on work that I missed or couldn't finish on day 2.  

Working with Matt L and Garrett was great, we finished our morning lab on time and with plenty of time for lunch!  We didn't hit any big snags and I learned a lot about traversing the dom! Getting used to jquery is hard but in the end looks to make things a lot easier.  Plus, I learned from matt L that multiple people can work on the same branch of a repo remotely as long as they are all collaborators, which honestly would've been really helpful for our 201 final project so that we didn't have to make a new branch every time we switched computers.  Overall really happy with how today went and I'm excited to learn more!
