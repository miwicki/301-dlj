Excited to do the project with Dre! I feel like we work really well together and get along in general, so even if we're having complications at any stage I feel like we'll be able to push through.  I'll admit I'm not feeling super confident about my understanding of the concepts as it is a lot of new stuff that keeps building on each other pretty quickly, and with all the concepts being fairly difficult to understand right w=away, I can't help but feel like I'm behind.  However, I'm trying my hardest and I'm determined to make it through to the end.  

PS. Seriously Considering .net 401 as both Dre and Ariel are going into it and they're starting to convince me lol
