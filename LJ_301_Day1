## Code 301 Day 1

Got started on Coding right away! Totally expecting a chill day to be honest but all the projects went fine so I can't complain.  It's going to take some getting used to for morning lab time and afternoon lecture; felt like falling asleep in lecture today just due to the time of day.  With it being after working code and lunch, it's hard to keep focused at the least.  Still, loving the new additions to our class and looking forward to getting to know them all!
