##Daily Learning Journal Nov 18

The presentation was great!! It seemed like everybody loved it and was giving us praise after the fact so I'm really proud of our team and what we were able to accomplish.  The entire class was so awesome and their projects were so cool as well, it's tough to see everyone parting ways for the 401s.  We had a great time afterwards celebrating and I wish everyone luck for whatever they decide to do next.  Thanks for the great two months!
