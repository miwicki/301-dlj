That test was super hard! I passed, which is always a plus, but I heard some really smart people getting 26/30 scores and that's crazy! Idk, I'm happy it's over and ready to go into project week.  I've got a good group and we all seem to be working well with each other so far for planning so I'm excited to get started!
