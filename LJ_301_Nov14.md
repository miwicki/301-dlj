##Daily Learning Journal Nov 14

First day of project week went well! It took a little longer to plan and work out our ideas than we had originally thought, but I'm happy with the progress we made by the end of the day! We've gotten the functionality down of calling 20 events from the api along with the list of characters and comics involved, all in 1 api call, so we shouldn't burn through our calls too fast hopefully.  Next step is appending the characters and comics from that api call, within the event object, to the page within a dropdown menu or table.  Excited to get started, but I'll probably end up helping with css today which is my wekest area.
