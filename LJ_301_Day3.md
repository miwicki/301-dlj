## Code 301 Daily Learning Journal Day 3 - First Week Done

I felt like I was totally on par for the most part until the run-through of the weekend lab assignment with Allie... honestly even though I followed along well enough with her code she was putting in, I barely had any idea what was going on and was just frantically trying to type in the code she was putting up! It seemed like what she was explaining was making sense, but I doubt I would've been able to do any of that on my own.  But so far, finishing the assignment over the weekend hasn't been too bad, and the Code Wars assignments haven't been too bad either, so I'm hoping to be all done soon and prepared for Monday morning.

It all seems manageable now but I'm trying to prepare myself for when we might not get morning labs finished on time; we might have to stay later hours to finish our pair programming together at some points and I need to be ready for that!
