##Code 301 Daily Learning Journal Nov 9

Feeling much better than yesterday; honestly it's pretty relieving considering how lost Dre and I were during the project.  We felt so behind, and at some points didn't even know what we had done or what we were trying to do.  But today we are almost caught up and I couldn't be any happier.  Especially with project week eminent, it's nice to be more on par with the class than yesterday.
