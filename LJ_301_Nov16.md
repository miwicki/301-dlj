Finished the MVP for functionality! Getting that to work was a lot harder than any of us anticipated; we thought calling the characters and comics would be easy after getting it to work for events... practically cut and paste, right?

What none of us knew at the time was that having two api calls simultaneously loaded and appending to the DOM royally screws up the logic behind it.  We thought we were close with nested callback functions within callback functions, to have our chain of chronological functions running in an order we set, but instead of being sequential, it actually loaded as step 3, 2, 1, then 4... so we eventually needed to reorder our logic of calling functions in all of the .then sequences.  A little confusing still but we got it to work so that's all that matters!

Looking forward to it all being done, it's gonna look great!!
